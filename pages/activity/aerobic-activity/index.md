# Aerobic Activity

<img src={aerobicActivity01} />

Aerobic activity increases your heart rate and breathing. Build up to doing at least
150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity (like a brisk walk, light cycling or water exercise) to vigorous activity (like jogging, singles tennis or hiking hills). Youâ€™ll improve the way your body stores and uses glucose, as well as your stamina and heart health.

### What?

<img src={aerobicActivity02} />

Any rhythmic, continuous activity

### How often?

<img src={aerobicActivity03} />

3-7 Days/week

### How hard?

<img src={aerobicActivity04} />

Fairly light to somewhat hard

### How much?

Start w/a few minutes. Gradually build up to 30-60 minutes over the day.

**Remember**: Fit in 5 or 10 minutes here and there. Or go for 20-30 minutes. Be active however and wherever you can. To lose weight, do twice as much activity.

### Aerobic Activity Cautions

To stay safe and injury free:

- Start with light to medium effort.
- Gradually increase your pace and time spent being active. Start low and go slow!
- Warm up and cool down at an easy pace before and after exercise.
