# Getting Started

Do you want to feel better, move better and sleep better? Experts now say that any physical activity counts toward better health – even just a few minutes! Being active is a great way to improve the way your body uses insulin and burn more calories to control your weight. Just one session of aerobic activity improves blood glucose (blood sugar) and insulin action up to 24 hours or longer!

### Keep It Simple

Just sit less and move around more! Walk to the mailbox. Walk the dog. Dance in the kitchen. Take the stairs. Find opportunities to move throughout your day. It all adds up. Are there any exercises you should avoid?

### Talk with Your Doctor

Talk to your health care provider before you start a new exercise program. Ask if you are on a diabetes drug that can cause low blood glucose or makes it hard to lose weight.

### Build a Plan

Ask to meet with a certified diabetes educator (CDE) or members of the health care team who can go over your diet, exercise and diabetes care plan.

### Blood Glucose

Learn when you should check your blood glucose and what to do if the numbers are too low or too high. Know the signs of low blood glucose and what to do if it happens.

### Diabetes Tips and Cautions

Keep a log of your exercise, blood glucose, meals and medications. This will help you learn how to keep your blood glucose in target.

Many types of diabetes drugs don’t usually cause low blood glucose, so you may not need extra snacks before or after activity.

Some diabetes drugs, like insulin and sulfonylureas, are more likely to cause low blood glucose. If you take these, tell your health care provider about any low blood glucose episodes. They can help you make changes to stay safe.

If you suspect low blood glucose (or experience shaking, abnormal sweating, loss of coordination) check it right away. If low, take 15 grams of carbohydrate. Carry glucose tablets, a sugary beverage or hard candy with you just in case.

Diabetes can cause damage to the nerves, eyes, kidney and heart. Your exercise plan may need to be adjusted. Everyone with diabetes should practice good foot and skin care, get dilated eye exams, and see the doctor regularly.
