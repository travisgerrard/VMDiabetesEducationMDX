Aerobic activity and strength training are at the heart of a program for those with type 2 diabetes. But you may enjoy and benefit from these other options.

### Take more steps

Use a smart phone or an activity tracker to measure your progress and stay motivated. Count your steps daily for the first week. Slowly build up to 7,000-9,000 steps/day.

### Flexibility

Stretch your muscles 2-3 days/week to the point of feeling tightness. Hold for 10-30 seconds (30- 60 seconds for older adults). For example, stretch your calves or the back of your thighs.

### Balance

Exercises may include standing on one foot, walking on a line, or using a balance board. Train in an uncluttered area and use a chair or wall for support if needed.

**Remember**: Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
