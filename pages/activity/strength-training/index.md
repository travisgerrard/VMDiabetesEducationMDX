# Strength Training

<img src={strengthTraining01} />

Strength training is important for people with diabetes because it builds muscle. Muscle tissue plays a big role in managing blood glucose, and you don’t have to be a body-builder! Plus, strength training can make daily activities like lifting laundry baskets or yardwork easier and safer.

### What?

Hand weights, resistance bands, weight machines, or your own body (for example, kitchen counter push-ups or chair squats)

### How often?

<img src={strengthTraining03} />

2-3 Days/week \*Rest day in between!

### How hard?

<img src={strengthTraining04} />

Start with light effort. Build up to medium or hard effort.

### How much?

<img src={strengthTraining05} />

10-15 repetitions to start (for each major muscle group) Build up to 8-10 reps of challenging effort.

**Remember**: If you need it, get help from a certified exercise professional. They can teach you the right way to do exercises and how to breathe properly.

### Strength Training Cautions

- Slowly increase how much you lift and how often.
- Avoid straining or holding your breath when lifting. This causes your blood pressure to go up.
- If you have severe diabetic retinopathy, don’t lift heavy weights.
