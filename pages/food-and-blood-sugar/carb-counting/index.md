Our bodies need a certain amount of carbohydrate for energy every day.

> Did you know that our brains and central nervous systems run primarily on glucose?

Meal planning with carb counting is another type of meal planning done by adding up how many total grams of carbohydrates you are eating at a meal or snack. It is also important to eat on time and have the right portions of carbohydrate when you are taking medications for blood sugar management. Your dietitian or diabetes educator can help teach you the right amount for your body and energy needs.
