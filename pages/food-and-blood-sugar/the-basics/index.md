# Food and Blood Sugar

What, how much and when you eat is very important for managing your blood sugar level. How does food affect my blood sugar? This section of the app will focus on two methods of meal planning â€“ the Diabetes Plate and Carbohydrate Counting.

Eating food is what gives us energy. Calories are energy and come from the amount of carbohydrate, protein, and fat that is found in food. Food also has water, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that do not give it calories, but provide other essential nutrients. Food works like the gas in your gas tank to give us energy.

All foods turn into energy or glucose (blood sugar) but at different speeds. Some foods will break down and increase blood sugar more quickly than others. Foods contain a combination of nutrients. Foods with similar amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat are put into the same food groups.

The foods that contain carbohydrate increase blood glucose the most. They start breaking down into glucose immediately in your mouth by the digestive enzymes in your saliva. As these foods travel in your body from your mouth -> stomach -> intestines, they are broken down into glucose that flows into your blood stream. The hormone insulin is the key that gets the sugar out of your blood and into the cells within your body to give you energy. Eating a balance of foods with fiber, protein and fat can stabilize blood glucose.
