The diabetes plate method is one of the easiest ways to meal plan. It is a visual guide to meal planning for the right portions of foods to manage your calorie needs from foods.

Tip: Start by using a 9 inch size plate. If your dinner plate is too large, you may use a salad plate.

Vegetables are classified into two groups: “non-starchy” or “starchy”.

Non-starchy vegetables have much water and natural fiber (or pulp) that helps stabilize blood sugars. They have about one-third of carbohydrate compared to starchy vegetables.

>
> - fish and shellfish
> - beef
> - chicken
> - dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese)
> - turkey
> - eggs
> - pork

> Plant foods with protein\*
>
> - beans, lentils, hummus
> - nuts, nut butter

Fill 25% of your plate with high quality carbohydrate foods.

Foods containing carbohydrate are important for brain function and energy.

At the same time, foods with carbohydrate have the most effect on blood glucose levels (compared to foods with protein and fat).

High quality carbohydrate foods are better on blood glucose than low quality carbohydrate foods because they have the natural fiber that digests much slower.

> High-quality carbohydrate foods:
> Grains:
>
> - 100% whole-grain bread
> - whole-grain cereal
> - whole-grain and lentil pasta
> - brown and wild rice
> - oatmeal
> - Corn tortilla
> - Popcorn
> - Quinoa
>
> Beans and legumes
>
> - Bean burgers
> - Black, kidney, pinto, and garbanzo beans
> - Hummus
