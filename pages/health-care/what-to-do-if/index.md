# What to do if....

**High blood sugar**

> - High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) occurs when there is too much sugar in the blood.
> - When high blood sugar continues for a long period of time, lasting damage to the body can occur.
> - Know the signs of high blood sugar. You may have an increased thirst, blurred vision, frequent urination, increased hunger and numbness or tingling of the feet.
> - High blood sugar occurs when glucose lowering medications are skipped; eat too much food or the wrong food; change or lowered activity levels, and sickness.
> - Check your blood sugar. If your blood sugar is greater than 300 persistently over 6 to 8 hours, call your diabetes providerâ€™s office.
> - **If your blood sugar is over 400, strongly consider presenting to the Emergency Room or an Urgent Care facility.**

**I get sick**

> - Blood sugar can be more difficult to control when you are sick.
> - Colds, fever, flu, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are all examples of common illnesses that can cause problems for people with diabetes.
> - Loss of body fluids (dehydration) from fever, vomiting, diarrhea, infection, and the stress of a sickness can all cause blood glucose levels to increase.
> - Because of this, it is very important to take your diabetes medicines and to eat some form of carbohydrate food when you are sick.
> - Liquid or soft foods are often tolerated, and they help to replace fluids.

These guidelines are intended for managing a short-term (48 hours or
less) sickness:
