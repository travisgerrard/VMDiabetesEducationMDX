It is very important that you record your blood sugar measurements. Many
persons use a blood glucose log such as posted on the [American Diabetes
Association website.](https://professional.diabetes.org/pel/blood-glucose-log-english)

Please bring your blood glucose log or your glucometer with you when you
visit your diabetes provider.
