# Testing blood sugar using a glucometer

The most common method of testing blood sugars is using a glucometer.

A glucometer measures the blood sugar at a specific point in time.

Using a small sharp needle called a lancet, a person pierces one finger.
A small drop of blood is placed on the test strip which the glucometer
processes the blood sugar. The blood sugar level is digitally displayed
within seconds on the glucometer.

There are several different glucometer manufacturers who use different
test strips. Your insurance carrier will verify the test strips the
insurance covers.

Many people check their blood sugar first thing in the morning, before
meals and at bedtime. Your diabetes provider may make recommendations
for additional blood sugar testing if you are making changes to your
medications, activity or diet.
