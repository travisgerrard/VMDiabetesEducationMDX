# Eating Well

Food choices and the portion sizes of the food we eat directly affects
blood sugar level

One method of being mindful of portion size is the plate method of
portion.

> - Choose a plate about 9 inches in diameter - any larger and you may be
>   eating more than is recommended for a meal.
> - Once you have the recommended plate size, fill the plate about half
>   full of non-starchy vegetables.
> - Then allot a quarter of the plate for starchy foods and a quarter of
>   the plate to protein.
