# Exercise

Persons with diabetes are recommended to exercise briskly at least 30
minutes a day 5 days a week.

> - Walking briskly is about 100 steps a minute-you should be able to
>   carry on a conversation but not sing. Brisk is a measure of exertion
>   rather than speed.

If you cannot fit a longer workout during your day, spread your activity
out through the day.

Muscle building activities such as lifting weights are recommended at
least two days a week on nonconsecutive days.

If you have not exercised for a while, talk to your diabetes provider
about your personal exercise goals in terms of time and intensity of
exercise

Avoid being sedentary for long periods of time. Get up every 30 minutes
and move for a few minutes.

# How exercise helps

During exercise, the body burns glycogen, a storage form of glucose in
the liver and muscle.

After exercise, hours later your muscles replenish the glycogen stores
by absorbing glucose from the bloodstream.

The more glycogen that is burned during exercise, the more glucose is
pulled from the blood stream. The body can use the glucose circulating
in the blood and the bodyâ€™s response to insulin improves.

Your blood sugar can be lower during and after exercise.

Sometimes after long exercise, your blood sugar can be lower the next
morning.

> - It is important to check your blood sugars before and after
>   exercising.
> - If you are experiencing low sugars when you are exercising, please
>   talk to your provider about ways to prevent low sugars.{' '}
