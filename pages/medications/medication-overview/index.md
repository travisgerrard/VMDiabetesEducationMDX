Congratulations for making it this far in your diabetes education.

Before we start to discuss the many different medications available to
control diabetes, it's worth setting up some broad categories.

The first set of categories is oral medications versus injectable
medications.

The second set of categories is medications that may cause low blood
sugar (hypoglycemia) versus those that do not.

There are a lot of medications for diabetes, and it can be overwhelming.

You donâ€™t have to know how all medications work, but use this section to
learn more about medications that you may already be taking or ones that
you are interested in taking.
