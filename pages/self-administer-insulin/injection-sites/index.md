# Common Injection Sites for Insulin

A person needs to inject insulin into the layer of fat directly under
the skin, known as subcutaneous tissue.

The abdomen is a common site for insulin injections that many people
with diabetes choose. The abdomen is easy to access and often less
painful than other sites due to protection by fat, a greater surface
area and less muscle. The site should be between two inches between the
waist and the hip bones and two inches away from the belly button. Do
not inject near any scar tissue.

Daily, the insulin injection sites should be rotated so that no one site
is injected frequently. A person’s skin may become thickened over time,
affecting the body’s ability to absorb the insulin.

A picture of options for daily rotation of insulin injection sites of
the abdomen is depicted below. Additional areas of the body where
insulin may be injected include the thighs, buttocks and arms as shown
in the illustration. Avoid injecting into the same site over and over.
Speak to your health provider for any questions related to insulin
injections.
