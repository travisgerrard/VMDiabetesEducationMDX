# How to Use an Insulin Pen

Insulin pens got their name because they are about the size and shape of
writing pens. Insulin pens contain cartridges pre-filled with insulin.
The pen is dialed for your recommended insulin dose.

Gather the supplies you will need:

> - ✓ Insulin pen
> - ✓ Needle
> - ✓ Alcohol swab

Remove the needle cover.

Prime the pen and clear air from the needle. Turn the dose selector knob
at the end of the pen to 2 units — watch dose markings change with
turning of the knob.

Hold the pen with the needle pointing upward.

Press dose knob up completely while watching for insulin drop or stream
to appear.

The dial should be back at zero after completing the priming.

Turn dose knob to dial in your insulin dose. The pen will allow you to
receive only the amount that you have set.

Double-check the dose window to make sure the correct dose is selected.

Clean a small area of skin with an alcohol swab.

Let the alcohol dry completely before you inject.

Inject insulin.

Curl fingers around the upper end of the pen to hold secure. Poise
thumb, above the dose knob.

Gently pinch up skin with your free hand.

Quickly insert the needle at a 90° angle. Release the pinch.

Use our thumb to press down on the dose knob until it stops-the dose
window will be back at zero. Leave the needle in place for 5–10 seconds
to help prevent insulin from leaking out of the injection site.

Pull the needle from your skin and press your finger or an alcohol swab
over the spot you gave your injection.

Utilize the “scoop” method of removing the insulin needle from the pen
cartridge.

Place the pen on a hard surface next to the external pen needle cover.

Guide the used pen needle into the external pen needle cover.

Twist the needle cover onto the pen twisting until the needle is removed
from the cartridge.
