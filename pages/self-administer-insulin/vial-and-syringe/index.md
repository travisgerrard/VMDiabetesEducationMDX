# Drawing and Injecting Insulin Using a Vial and Syringe

Gather the supplies you will need:

> - ✓ Alcohol swabs
> - ✓ Insulin syringe
> - ✓ Bottle of insulin

Wash your hands.

If you are taking cloudy insulin such as NPH, or premixed insulin, roll
the bottle between the palms of your hands until it is uniformly cloudy.

Never shake a bottle of insulin.

Prepare the insulin vial: Wipe the top of the insulin bottle with an
alcohol swap.

Remove the needle cap and pull the plunger down to allow air to enter
the syringe.

The air in the syringe should be equal to your dose of insulin.

Push the needle through the center of the rubber top of the insulin
bottle.

Inject air into the insulin bottle by pushing the plunger down until all
of the air is in the vial.

Leave the needle in the insulin bottle. This makes it easier for you to
draw the insulin out of the bottle.

Turn the insulin bottle and syringe upside down.

Pull the plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the line
indicating the number of insulin units you need.

Look for air bubbles in your syringe.

Air bubbles in the syringe mean that you will get less insulin.

If you have air bubbles stuck at the walls of the syringe, you can
gently tap the side of the syringe to let the air bubble float to the
top and push back into the insulin vial.

Check your syringe to make sure you have your insulin dose and no air
bubbles.

Ask your nurse to show you other ways to get rid of air bubble.

If needle bends while drawing up the insulin, do not straighten it.
Properly dispose of the syringe and start again.

Pull the needle out of the vial.

Clean a small area of skin with an alcohol swab. Let the alcohol dry
completely before you inject. An injection practice pillow is used for
illustration in the picture shown above.

Pick up the syringe and hold it like a pencil.

Do not let the needle touch anything.

Pinch up your skin.

Push the needle through the skin.

Push the insulin in with the plunger.

Wait 3–5 seconds before pulling out the needle to make sure no insulin
leaks out of your skin.

Pull the needle out of your skin.

Press your finger or an alcohol swab over the spot you gave your
injection.

Do not rub the injection site.
