# Understanding insulin resistance

The food we eat is broken down in the stomach into glucose that is
absorbed into our blood. The blood carries the glucose to our muscles
and organs where the glucose is used as fuel.

Glucose does not move freely into the muscle and organs on its own.
There is a door it must pass through that is controlled by the hormone,
insulin. Insulin is the key that allows glucose to move from the blood
to the body.

In persons with type 2 diabetes, the body does not respond to the
insulin signal of high levels of glucose in the blood. The insulin does
not open the cell doors to the muscles and the organs. In response, the
body produces large quantities of insulin from the signal for the key to
unlock cells for glucose. Thus, excess levels of insulin and glucose are
circulating in the blood which the body cannot use.

Patients can reduce insulin resistance and help the body become more
sensitive to inulin by exercising, following a diabetic diet low in
carbohydrates and fats, and taking all medications as prescribed. A
diabetic diet means eating healthy food choices at regular mealtimes.
