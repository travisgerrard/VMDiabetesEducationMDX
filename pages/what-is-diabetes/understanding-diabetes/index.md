# Understanding Type 2 Diabetes

Our bodies use glucose as fuel by taking glucose into cells, the
building blocks of our body, and changing the glucose into energy.

Glucose does not go into our cells on its own. It needs a very important
hormone called insulin to enter the cells of our body.

In most diabetics there is an excess of insulin in the blood, but the
cells do not respond well to the hormone insulin.

When the body does not respond normally to the insulin signal, excess
sugars build up in the blood instead of going into the tissue cells.

When the cells of the body do not respond well to the hormone insulin,
the condition is called insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance leads to high levels of sugar in the blood
(hyperglycemia).

The effect of prolonged high blood sugar levels can cause many health
problems which we will discuss later.
